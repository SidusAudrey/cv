          <p>Ruby Parker is a former chef turned baker. When her love for sweets seemed to be taking over her life,
            she was inspired to make her favourite desserts herself. She enrolled herself into the Holly Pastries Academy.
            Upon completing the four year course, she went on to work under several well known patisseurs. Now she has finally
            opened her own bakery.</p></td>
